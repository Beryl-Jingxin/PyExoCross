[*PyExoCross*](https://github.com/ExoMol/PyExoCross "PyExoCross") is a Python adaptation of the [*ExoCross*](https://github.com/ExoMol/ExoCross "ExoCross") Fortran application.

*PyExoCross* is designed for postprocessing the huge molecular line lists generated by the ExoMol project and other similar initiatives such as the HITRAN and HITEMP. *PyExoCross* generates absorption and emission spectra and other properties (partition functions, specific heats, cooling functions, lifetimes, oscillator strengths and stick spectra) based on molecular line lists. *PyExoCross* calculates cross sections with four line profiles: Doppler, Gaussian, Lorentzian and Voigt; a number of options are available for computing Voigt profiles. *PyExoCross* can convert data format between ExoMol and HITRAN. *PyExoCross* supports importing and exporting line lists in the ExoMol and HITRAN/HITEMP formats.
