# Introduction

[PyExoCross](https://github.com/ExoMol/PyExoCross "PyExoCross") is a Python adaptation of the [ExoCross](https://github.com/ExoMol/ExoCross "ExoCross") Fortran application (Yurchenko, A&amp;A, 614, A131 (2018) [link](https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201732531)).

*PyExoCross* is designed for postprocessing the huge molecular line lists generated by the ExoMol project and other similar initiatives such as the HITRAN and HITEMP. *PyExoCross* generates absorption and emission spectra and other properties (partition functions, specific heats, cooling functions, lifetimes and stick spectra) based on molecular line lists. *PyExoCross* calculates cross sections with four line profiles: Doppler, Gaussian, Lorentzian and Voigt; a number of options are available for computing Voigt profiles. *PyExoCross* can convert data format between ExoMol and HITRAN. *PyExoCross* supports importing land exporting line lists in the ExoMol and HITRAN/HITEMP formats.
