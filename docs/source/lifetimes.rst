Lifetimes
===================

Please provide the line list files. 
You don't need to change anything in lifetime section.

The lifetimes equation is:

.. math::

   \tau_i = \frac{1}{{\textstyle \sum_{f} A_{fi}}}.

*Example*

.. code:: bash

    # Calculate lifetimes #
    None

**Note**

If the line lists data is not in the ExoMol format, please convert your
data format into the ExoMol format at first and then compute partition
functions with *PyExoCross*.
