## Run PyExoCross

In the terminal, use the following commands to run PyExoCross:

```bash
python3 pyexocross.py -p input_filepath
```

If the input filepath is `/home/username/PyExoCross/input/H2O_exomol.inp`

```bash
python3 pyexocross.py -p ./input/H2O_exomol.inp
# OR 
python3 pyexocross.py -p /home/username/PyExoCross/input/H2O_exomol.inp
```

If you want to run program in conda environment which is named as 'exomol', please use command:

```bash
/home/username/anaconda3/envs/exomol/bin/python pyexocross.py -p ./input/H2O_exomol.inp
```

If you need to run program in background, please use command:

```bash
nohup python3 -u pyexocross.py -p ./input/H2O_exomol.inp > ./output/H2O_exomol.out 2>&1 &
# OR 
nohup /home/username/anaconda3/envs/exomol/bin/python -u pyexocross.py -p ./input/H2O_exomol.inp > ./output/H2O_exomol.out 2>&1 &
```

## Notes for input file

1. All information can be written in the input file. Just change the information you will use.You don't need to change any other unnecessary information.Please do not change the first column strings.
2. If you met problems, jupyter notebook `.ipynb` code is stored for checking and testing.

    abstract = {PyExoCross is a Python adaptation of the ExoCross Fortran application, 
                PyExoCross is designed for post-processing the huge molecular line lists generated by the ExoMol project 
                and other similar initiatives such as the HITRAN and HITEMP data bases. 
                PyExoCross generates absorption and emission stick spectra, cross-sections, and other properties 
                (partition functions, specific heats, cooling functions, lifetimes, and oscillator strengths) 
                based on molecular line lists. PyExoCross calculates cross-sections with four line profiles: 
                Doppler, Gaussian, Lorentzian, and Voigt profiles in both sampling and binned methods; 
                a number of options are available for computing Voigt profiles which we test for speed and accuracy. 
                PyExoCross supports importing and exporting line lists in the ExoMol and HITRAN/HITEMP formats. 
                PyExoCross also provides conversion between the ExoMol and HITRAN data formats. 
                In addition, PyExoCross has extra code for users to automate the batch download of 
                line list files from the ExoMol data base.},
